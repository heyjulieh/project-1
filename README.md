SneakerHub is a place for sneakerheads and enthusiasts to check the latest shoe fashions, releases, drop locations, and reviews.

Created by two General Assembly Web Development Immersive students: Julie Huang and Kevin Tse.

We saw a need to provide quality and accurate sneaker info to our community and built an API to meet those demands.  We love how it turned out.  Feel free to comment!
