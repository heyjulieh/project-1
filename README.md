# Project 1: SNEAKERHUB
## Description


This project was created by Julie Huang & Kevin Tse, who are both students in General Assembly's Web Development Immersive Program. Both Julie and Kevin hold a great love for sneakers and felt that a web application that allowed sneaker lovers to come together to crowdsource/share their thoughts and resources on the hottest sneakers-- from the past and at present-- and would be of great use personally, as well as for friends looking to "cop the latest pair".

You can find our deployed app here: https://thawing-ocean-17046.herokuapp.com/

## Front-End

The front-end or client-side aspects of our web application were made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Libraries used included JQuery (for functions) and Materialize (for a centralized and responsive design)

### Pages

The main page shows all the sneakers from our seed file-- consisting only of Julie and/or Kevin's picks.

The source page shows all the sneakers from our seed file as well as any shoes created by users. This page allows posting, updating, and deleting of sneaker data. **It is advised that users only delete user postings, and not seed data.** Please note that all images used on this web application is not ours and this web application is currently only for educational purposes.

## Back-End

The back-end or server-side aspects of our web application were made using javascript, Jquery, Mongoose, Express, and body-parser.

## API Reference

API data in JSON format can be found at api/shoes and api/source.

## Bugs

While it is possible to edit data on the source page, previous unedited data does not show as guidance for users. We are currently working on this issue.

## Future Additions

In the future, we would like to use store location and/or brand location data to create an interactive map that shows users where they can get the shoes that are listed on the various pages of our web application. We would also like to add a search bar that allows user to look for shoes using brand and shoe name keywords.
